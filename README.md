# Luke Doughty Portfolio

_This was forked from a template repo to setup vite_

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Why?

I originally had the idea to make a portfolio like this having seen this https://bruno-simon.com/ website. This is my first full R3F project so its definitely not the cleanest.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è What

In this portfolio, there are currently 3 holes to complete. Each level then lets the user see a new part of my portfolio, be that Github Links or a CV.

## üò≠ Challenges

Since this is my first full "project" using ThreeJS, it was a very steep learning curve. Having said that, the most recent commits vs original commits have gotten alot better.

## üéØ Todo

Theres still alot of work to be done here:

- Hole 2 and 3 are not the most optimal layout (if you have played it you'll know what I mean).
- Theres currently just some basic level of damping on the ball, needs fine tuning
- A way to stop the ball as waiting for damping is really boring for the player
- Sound Effects! (its eerily quiet for minigolf)
- Style modals, currently I'm just using basic Chakra-UI as its not been my focus - I'm not a UI Designer!
- Cleanup code, theres models that arent used in here, some code is commented but not others
- Likely move all styling into css, its just easier and neater
- A Vercel Key-Value storage for player scores!
